Group project that started in the middle of January 2019 - team work ended in the end of June 2019. After that period I try to develop it further. 

How to run this application?

Application is configured to work with MSSQL database, but by default it works with in memory DBContext (In memory context is initialized every time application starts), so no configuring should be needed.

There is one default administrator account that has access to admin panel:

Username: administrator@adm.com
Password: !1234Qwertyuiop

Software is written in c# using many technologies including:

.Net Core
Asp.Net MVC Core
Entity Framework Core
Serilog
Asp.Net Identity
